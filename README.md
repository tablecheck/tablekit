## Publishing Packages

Publishing packages is handled automatically via GitHub Actions

## Building a package manually

- Run `lerna run build --scope=@tablecheck/tablekit-button`

## Creating new Packages

- run `npm run new-package` and follow the prompts. This can take several minutes to correctly bootstrap the packages together after creation.
- At this point everything should be ready to start developing with `npm start`
- Continue modifying the files in the `src` folder as needed

## Removing unsused packages

- delete the package folder in `packages/<package-name>`
- remove the entry for the package in `.@tablecheck-react-systemrc.json`

IMPORTANT! Before merging the MR, make sure the commit message has the scope of the component. Example: `feat(newpackage): added New Package`
