Alerts to notify the user of events, communication actions that are required or that have taken place.

[Badges](/design/components/badges)

A badge, sometimes called a tag or label, is a UI atom which indicates a status, notification, or event that appears in relativity with the underlying object.

[Buttons](/design/components/buttons)

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.
