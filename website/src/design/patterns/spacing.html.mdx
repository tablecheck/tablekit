# Spacing

<IntroText>
  Spacing is based on the 8px grid using a T-shirt sizing method from XS to XXL.
  All sizes are derived from a base of 16px (1em) Medium size. There are three
  types of spacing used - inset, stack and inline. These types can be combined
  to achieve the desired effect, as shown in the examples.

## [Inset](website/src/design/patterns/spacing.html#inset)

Inset spacing indents content on all four sides. Itâ€™s use is widespread, across many components at varying sizes.
