# Buttons

<IntroText>
  Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They
  communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages
  in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the
  user interacts with it.

## [Varients](website/src/design/components/buttons.html#varients)

### With icon

#

Each variant of the button component has its own use-case for both establishing hierarchy, and improving usability.

#

**Primary:**
As the main action button which stands out due to its strong color, the primary button should be used sparingly, typically once per page/content for key actions example “Pay Now“ & “Save”

**Secondary:**
The secondary button is the next highest priority, can be used as desired, should not be used for the main action on screen.

**Tertiary:**
Should be used for lower priority actions typically alongside the secondary button.

**Ghost:**
Is typically used when there is a need for a lot of buttons, it has a faint outline to show separation while being easy on the eye when used

**Bare:**
The bare button is typically used within other componentssuch as tables or menus where having a background or outline would not work well.

**Disabled:**
All disabled-buttons regardless of variant or state will have the same appearance.
