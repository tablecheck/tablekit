# TableCheck Contributor Code Of Conduct

All contributors should act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
welcoming, and healthy community. Open source software development is an
iterated game: your behavior should encourage reciprocal engagement and
contribution from other community members, and vice-versa, to maximize shared
benefit over the long-term.

Participation in TableCheck projects and forums is a privilege, not a right. As
the community moderator, TableCheck may, at its sole discretion, restrict the
participation of persons whom it deems to be acting in an aggressive, offensive,
bad-faith, off-topic, unprofessional, or otherwise counter-productive manner.
